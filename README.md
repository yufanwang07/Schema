# Event Schema Manager

This is a web-based tool for managing and injecting event schemas.

## Setup

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Open a terminal in the project root and run the following command to install the required Node.js packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Start the Application:**
    Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the application with:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This will start both the back-end server and the React front-end in development mode. The application will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Project Structure

-   `src/`: Contains the React front-end application code.
    -   `src/App.js`: The main application component.
-   `public/`: Contains the static assets for the front-end.
